## About Me

I am a VLSI Master's student at the University of Michigan. I am currently working as a graduate student research assistant in the 
<a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~reetudas/researchgroup.html" target="_blank">M-Bits Research Group</a> on transformer hardware acceleration and spiking neural network
algorithms for edge vision. In the past I've worked on efficient hardware for machine learning at <a href="https://memryx.com" target="_blank">MemryX</a> and the <a href="https://lugroup.engin.umich.edu" target="_blank">Wei Lu Nanoelectronics Group</a>.

## Research Interests

- **Neuromorphic Computing:** spiking neural networks, event-based vision,
  reservoir computing
- **Hardware Accelerators:** machine learning accelerators, multimedia accelerators
- **CPU Design:** heterogeneous multi-core processors, vector acceleration
  engines
