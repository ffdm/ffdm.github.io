## About Me

I am a senior computer engineering undergraduate at the University of Michigan. I am currently working as a research assistant in the 
<a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~reetudas/researchgroup.html" target="_blank">M-Bits Research Group</a> on spiking neural network
algorithms for energy efficient automotive vision. In the past I have worked in the <a href="https://lugroup.engin.umich.edu" target="_blank">Wei Lu Nanoelectronics Group</a>
to design a FPGA-based machine learning hardware system for classification of mouse neural spikes using an RRAM array.
